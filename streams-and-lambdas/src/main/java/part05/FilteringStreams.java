 * Filtering streams is a common operation. For example, you may want to make a
 * stream that only contains numbers or strings that meet certain criteria.
 *
 * In this exercise, you will learn how to filter streams using the filter()
 * method. Like the map() method, the filter() method typically takes a lambda
 * expression or a method reference as a parameter. The result of the lambda
 * expression must be a boolean value. If the result is true, the element is
 * included in the resulting stream. If the result is false, the element is
 * filtered out.
